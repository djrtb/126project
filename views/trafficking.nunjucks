            <h2 class="content-subhead">What is Sex Trafficking</h2>
            <p>
              Sex trafficking, a form of modern slavery, is the exploitation of women
              and children within national and across international borders, for the purposes of
              forced sex work.  This occurs when someone uses force, fraud or coercion to
              intimidate an adult, and even minors, to commit and engage in sexual acts.
              Commercial sexual exploitation includes pornography, prostitution
              and sex trafficking of women and girls, and is characterized by the exploitation
              of a human being in exchange for goods or money.

              <h3>The Sex Industry</h3>
              <p>
                Currently, sex trafficking is a booming industry and it thrives because there is
                a serious demand. (1) BUYER fuels the market with money, (2) TRAFFICKER/PIMP exploits
                victims to earn revenue from buyers, (3) VICTIM, which includes both girls and boys,
                are bought and sold for profit. Adult women make up the largest group of sex trafficking
                victims, followed by girl children, although a small percentage of men and boys are
                trafficked into the sex industry as well.
              </p>

              <p>
                Traffickers find victims through social network, home neighborhood, clubs and bars,
                internet, and school. They lure the victims with promises of protection, adventure, home,
                opportunity, and love. They use violence, fear, threats and intimidation tactics to
                ensure compliance and meet demands.
              </p>

              <h3>Impact of Sex Trafficking</h3>
              <p>
              Trafficking has a harrowing effect on the mental, emotional and physical well being
              of the women and girls ensnared in its web. Beyond the physical abuse, trafficked
              women suffer extreme emotional stress, including shame, grief, fear, distrust and
              suicidal thoughts. Victims often experience post-traumatic stress disorder, and
              with that, acute anxiety, depression and insomnia. Many victims turn to drugs and
              alcohol to numb the pain.

              Sex trafficking promotes societal breakdown by removing women and girls from their
              families and communities. Trafficking fuels organized crime groups that usually
              participate in many other illegal activities, including drug and weapons trafficking
              and money laundering. It negatively impacts local and national labor markets, due
              to the loss of human resources. Sex trafficking burdens public health systems. And
              trafficking erodes government authority, encourages widespread corruption, and
              threatens the security of vulnerable populations.
